Common Questions About My Environment
Hi! I get many questions about the code editor, terminal, etc, that I use. Here's what I am using at present:

Editor:

VS Code as my code editor - https://code.visualstudio.com/

I use 'Solarized Light' as my editor theme. This theme is built into VSCode by default.

In this course, you will frequently see my code 'jump', or reformat itself whenever I save a file. This is done automatically by https://prettier.io/

Terminal:

I use Iterm2 as my terminal - https://www.iterm2.com/

Inside my terminal, I run the shell https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh with the default theme 'Robby Russell'
